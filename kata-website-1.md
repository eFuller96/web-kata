# Website Kata 1

This kata is designed to introduce you to creating a web API using ASP.Net Core.

## Resources
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/web-api/?view=aspnetcore-2.1

## Prepare
1. verify dotnet version `dotnet --version` is higher than 2.0.0

## Kata
In this kata you will create a web API that can return a list of products

In a terminal:
1. Navigate to `.\app-website-1`
1. run `dotnet new webapi -n "ProductsApi"`
1. `cd ProductsApi`
1. run `dotnet restore`
1. run `dotnet build`
1. run `dotnet run`
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/api/Values` to check the project template works

### Debugging in Visual Studio

You can debug in Visual Studio by opening the `.csproj` file
When saving files you will be prompted to create a `.sln` and a launch settings file. Delete the launch settings file as you only want the `.sln` file.

You can now run by debugging in VS, or from the command line.

## Creating the products controller

Delete auto generated `ValuesController` and add new class `ProductsController` with contents:

```C#
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace ProductsApi.Controllers
{
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    public class ProductsController : Controller
    {
        [HttpGet]
        public IEnumerable<string> Get()
        {
            return new string[] { "SQL Source Control" };
        }
    }
}
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/api/Products` to check it works. You should see `SQL Source Control` in your browser.

**Note**: Remember to restart the server each time you change the code

## Creating a data model for products

Create a new folder called `Model`

In `Model` create a new class, `Product`, with properties:

```C#
public string Name { get; }
public string Description { get; }
```

Alter `Get()` in `ProductsController` to return an `IEnumerable<Product>`

Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/api/Products` to check it works

## Reading products from in-memory storage

Amend `ProductsController` to maintain a collection of products

Create a parameter-less constructor for `ProductsController` and initialize your collection

Return your collection in `Get()`

Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/api/Products` to check it works


## Adding new products

Create a new method on `ProductsController` to handle Post requests:

```C#
[HttpPost]
public void Post([FromBody] Product value) { }
```

Add logic to add the product from the post request to your collection

In order to test a POST request you'll need some tooling. I recommend Postman: https://www.getpostman.com/

Send a POST request to `http://localhost:5000/api/Products` with a Content-Type of `application/json` and body:

```
{
	"Name": "Readyroll",
	"Description": "Ready to roll"
}
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/api/Products` to check it works

## It doesn't work!

This is because controllers are instantiated per request

In order to persist data across requests we need to use dependency injection

First create a new directory `Store`, and a class, `ProductStore`

Move the logic for persisting the `Product` collection to `ProductStore`

e.g. it should have a contract like:

```C#
public IEnumerable<Product> GetAll();

public void Add(Product product);
```

Now make `ProductsController` depend on the new `ProductStore` by passing it in the constructor and assigning it to a field

Finally, in `Startup`, find `ConfigureServices()` and add the following line:

`services.AddSingleton<ProductStore>();`

This will register `ProductStore` with the dependency injection system

Because we're using singleton scope, all controller instances that ask for a product store will now have access to the same one

Now make the POST request again, and navigate to `http://localhost:5000/api/Products` to see if it works

See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-2.1 for more details about dependency injection

## How does it work?
Look at the signature for `Post` in `ProductsController` again

```C#
public void Post([FromBody] Product value)
```

Notice the `[FromBody]` attribute. This means the value will be automatically parsed from JSON in the request body into the C# type. This process is known as 'Parameter binding'

## Getting a specific product with parameter binding

Parameters can be bound from the request URI also.

For instance, given: 

`GET http://localhost:5000/api/Products/SQL%20Source%20Control`

`Name` can be bound to an argument for your `Get` method

On `ProductsController` change the signature for `Get` to take a `string name`. e.g:

```c#
public IEnumerable<Product> Get(string name)
```

At the top of `ProductsController` and a new `Route` attribute to match part of the URI to the `name` argument in `Get`

```C#
[Route("api/[controller]/{name}")]
```

If no name is specified in the URI, then `name` will be `null`

Add logic to return products by name if the supplied `name` isn't `null`

Add a new product using a POST request, then search for it by name: e.g: `GET http://localhost:5000/api/Products/SQL%20Source%20Control`

**Note**: the routes are case sensitive
